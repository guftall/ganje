I want to create an open source project as web server of `insomnia`. so individuals or companies can host their own API server.

features are:
- Teams
- Multiple device login
- Workspaces
- Sync
- Examples
- Custom triggers
- Mock server based on one of Examples for each request
- Audit logs
- Export and import to Google Drive

i think i will use `Cassandra` as backend database, `C#` for backend language. `ASP.Net Core` for web framework and `SignalR` for synchronization.
